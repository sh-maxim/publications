# My software, libraries, websites and publications

## Software and libraries:

### *SecNet*
Deep convolutional neural network with 2% higher prediction accuracy for a 50-year-old problem of protein secondary structure prediction; in the last 20 years, 140 teams improved accuracy only by 3%; our improvement translates to 13 years of research with only 2 years of development; [github.com/sh-maxim/ss](https://github.com/sh-maxim/ss)

### *βTurnTool18* and *βTurnLib18*
Assignment turn tool and library compiled with hierarchical DBSCAN and kMedoids clustering of 13 thousand of 3D protein fragments; 11 new types are discovered and 1 is eliminated; 2,700 downloads; [github.com/sh-maxim/BetaTurn18](https://github.com/sh-maxim/BetaTurn18)

### *BAM (BioAssemblyModeler)*
GUI application for 3D modeling of protein complexes; 2,200 users and 500 users of the first and second versions; [dunbrack.fccc.edu/BAM](http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/BAM)

### *SCWRL4*
Cross-platform (Unix/Windows/Mac) program for atomic modeling of protein side chains; the most popular in the field; many commercial licenses; 9,000 users; [dunbrack.fccc.edu/scwrl4](http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/scwrl4)

### *Rotamer Library*
Statistically derived representation of protein side-chain atomic conformations, compiled from 4,000 protein structures using adaptive kernel density estimation and kernel regression of response variables; 900 users; [dunbrack.fccc.edu/bbdep2010](http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/bbdep2010)

### *BioDownloader*
GUI application for downloading, updating and routine processing of biological files from FTP and HTTP servers; 650 users; [dunbrack.fccc.edu/BioDownloader](http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/BioDownloader)
